### KPI-Driven Insights from the Billing Data

####  KPI 1: Total Active Revenue
- Active subscriptions generate strong revenue, especially from Enterprise and Pro plans.
- Annual billing contributes disproportionately to total active revenue, indicating high-value customer retention.

####  KPI 2: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- MRR shows seasonal fluctuations, with noticeable dips in Q1 and Q3.
- Q2 tends to show growth spikes, possibly tied to acquisition campaigns or renewal cycles.

####  KPI 3: Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- ARR is consistently higher than MRR, driven by long-term Enterprise contracts.
- ARR growth is steady, reinforcing its role in valuation and strategic planning.

####  KPI 4: Churn Rate by Month
- Churn spikes in March and September, especially among monthly Basic and Pro plans.
- Monthly billing correlates with higher churn, suggesting shorter commitment plans are more vulnerable.

####  KPI 5: Retention Rate by Month
- Retention remains above 85% in most months, with Enterprise plans showing the highest loyalty.
- Annual billing correlates with stronger retention, validating its use as a retention lever.

####  KPI 6: Failed Payment Rate
- Failed payments average ~35% across billing periods, with CreditCard and PayPal leading in failures.
- ACH is the most reliable method, suggesting a shift toward ACH could reduce billing risk.

####  KPI 7: Top Customers by Usage
- The top 5 customers account for ~15–20% of total usage, yet some are on Basic plans.
- These power users are ideal for upsell campaigns or case studies.

####  KPI 8: Long-Term Inactive Subscriptions
- Over 200 accounts have signup dates older than 2 years, many still marked Active.
- These may be stale or ghost accounts — ideal for cleanup or re-engagement.

####  KPI 9: Monthly Revenue Trends
- Revenue spikes in April and dips in February, suggesting seasonal buying behavior.
- Marketing and renewal efforts could be timed to align with these cycles.

####  KPI 10: Repeat Payment Failures
- Several accounts show 3+ failed payments, indicating systemic billing issues.
- These accounts should be flagged for dunning workflows or suspension review.

### Additional Insights

- **Usage vs. Plan Price Misalignment**: Some Basic users have usage amounts exceeding those on Pro or Enterprise plans — a clear upsell opportunity.
- **Post-Cancellation Payments**: A subset of cancelled subscriptions still show successful payments, likely due to billing cycle overlap or delayed processing.
- **ACH Reliability**: Across all KPIs, ACH consistently shows lower failure rates and higher retention — a strategic billing method.

### Business Recommendations

- Incentivize annual plans to reduce churn and boost ARR
- Promote ACH as the preferred payment method to reduce failures
- Target high-usage Basic users for upgrade campaigns
- Implement automated dunning workflows for overdue invoices and repeat failures
- Audit post-cancellation billing logic to prevent revenue leakage
- Align marketing pushes with seasonal usage spikes (e.g. Q2 growth)
- Clean up stale accounts to improve reporting accuracy and reduce noise
