# SaaS KPI SQL Analysis

Hey there — I'm Daniel, a data analyst who loves turning SaaS billing data into real business insight. This project dives into a simulated SaaS dataset using SQL to surface key metrics that help teams understand revenue, retention, and customer health.

## 🔍 What This Project Covers

I wrote a series of SQL queries to explore the kinds of KPIs that SaaS companies track every day. Each query includes comments explaining the logic and why it matters from a business perspective — because good analysis isn’t just technical, it’s strategic.

## 📊 KPIs Included

- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** – Predictable revenue growth
- **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** – Scaled view of MRR
- **Churn Rate** – Who’s leaving and when
- **Retention Rate** – Who’s sticking around
- **Failed Payment Rate** – Billing issues that impact cash flow
- **Top Customers by Usage** – High-value accounts worth watching
- **Long-Term Inactive Subscriptions** – Dormant revenue opportunities
- **Monthly Revenue Trends** – Seasonality and growth patterns
- **Repeat Payment Failures** – Systemic billing friction

## 💡 Why It Matters

These metrics help SaaS teams:
- Forecast revenue and spot churn early
- Improve billing operations and reduce payment failures
- Focus on customer success and retention
- Make smarter decisions with clearer data

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

- PostgreSQL (local setup)
- SQL (with business insight comments)
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Power BI & Tableau (dashboards coming soon)
