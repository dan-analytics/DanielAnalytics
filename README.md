# SaaS KPI SQL Analysis

Welcome! I'm Daniel, a data analyst specializing in SaaS metrics and business impact. This project explores a simulated SaaS billing dataset using SQL to extract actionable insights across Revenue Operations, Billing, Pricing, and Customer Analytics.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This repository contains SQL queries designed to surface key performance indicators (KPIs) that SaaS businesses rely on to monitor growth, retention, and revenue health. Each query is annotated with business context to demonstrate how technical logic translates into strategic insight.

## 📊 KPIs Explored

- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**: Tracks predictable revenue growth
- **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**: Scales MRR to annualized view
- **Churn Rate**: Identifies customer loss trends
- **Retention Rate**: Measures customer loyalty and product stickiness
- **Failed Payment Rate**: Flags billing friction and risk
- **Top Customers by Usage**: Highlights high-value accounts
- **Long-Term Inactive Subscriptions**: Surfaces dormant revenue
- **Monthly Revenue Trends**: Reveals seasonality and growth patterns
- **Repeat Payment Failures**: Detects systemic billing issues

## 🧠 Business Impact

These metrics help SaaS teams:
- Forecast revenue and cash flow
- Identify churn risks and retention opportunities
- Optimize billing operations and reduce payment failures
- Prioritize customer success and account management

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- PostgreSQL (local setup)
- SQL (with business insight comments)
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Power BI & Tableau (dashboards coming soon)

## 📁 Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `saas_kpi_analysis.sql` | SQL queries with business insight annotations |
| `README.md` | Project overview and strategic context |

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Build interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau
- Upload `.pbix` and `.twbx` files to visualize KPIs
- Add case studies and visual walkthroughs
- Expand to cohort analysis and pricing segmentation
